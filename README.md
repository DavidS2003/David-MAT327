I picked a dataset consisting of motor vehicle collisions because many individuals are victims of car collisions every year and I feel like this isnâ€™t acknowledged enough. I found this dataset in NYC Open Data. The NYPD collected the data. This data is from April 28th 2014 to the present. The data contains information on motor vehicle collisions.
